AstroBot features 6 commands as well as a scheduling feature that enables daily automatic posts sent to a given Discord text channel.
It was created using the Discord.py library as well as SQLite3 for keeping record of the channels requesting automated daily uploads for NASA's APOD and/or AstroBin's IOTD.
